# Excelsior FreeIPA CA Injector

The **Excelsior CA Injector** is a portable installer that pulls the current **FreeIPA Certificate Authority (CA)** from your identity infrastructure and installs it into any **Ubuntu/Debian** system's trust store.

This is designed for internal use across Excelsior-managed fleets, air-gapped labs, retro racks, and edge nodes that require trusted communication with `*.excelsior.lan` or core CA-backed services.
